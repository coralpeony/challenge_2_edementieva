# Bootcamp: UK-VIRT-FE-PT-11-2022-U-LOLC-TWTH-1 Challenge Two

## Description

The task in this Challenge is to create a portfolio of work to showcase skills and talents to employers. 

In this portfolio I applied the core skills we've recently learned, such as flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables.

This portfolio highlights my first Challenge as the strongest work I've done so far.
